# Batch-Program: A program made in batch that mimicks the like of an OS


Disclamer:
Keep in mind that the assets I used are not my intellectual property and are owned by Microsoft.
Im talking about the Windows XP startup sound.

# Batch OS is a program made in VBScript and Batch. 
I made this program for fun and have no plans of funding it so I made it open - source. 
Anyone can make changes to this program.

There are only three main focuses for this program:


1.) Stability:

Make sure that this program crashes less often. Make it more stable.

2.) Presentation:

This program will always look like a CLI. 

3.) Fun:

This program is not to be taken seriously. I have hidden a bunch of easter eggs in this program. Find them all!
